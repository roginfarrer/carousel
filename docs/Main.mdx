# useCarousel

`useCarousel` is an unstyled React component that provides the behavior and accessibility implementation for building a carousel. Unlike many other carousels, this implementation uses the latest browser and DOM APIs for scrolling and snapping. And because it's a hook, the styling is up to you!

- Comprehensive behavior and accessibility coverage for all elements of a carousel, including pagination, infinite scrolling, autoplay, and more.
- Native browser scroll snapping and animations-no external libraries for animation.
- Design modeled after Adobe's React Stately and React Aria libraries, and uses their [Collection][collection] API.
- Written in TypeScript.

## Features

- Native **browser scroll-snapping and smooth-scrolling** for performant transitions across pointer types.
- Follows the **carousel ARIA pattern**, providing the building blocks for the root container, scrolling container, carousel items, next and previous buttons, and pagination, and semantically links them all together.
- Support for showing **one or many items per page**, implemented with responsive-design.
- Support for **vertical and horizontal** scrolling.
- Support for **infinite scrolling**.
- Support for **autoplay** with affordances for disabling it.
- Support for **mouse dragging**.
