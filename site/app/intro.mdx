**React Aria Carousel** is a collection of React hooks and components that provide the behavior and accessibility implementation for building a carousel. Unlike many other carousels, this implementation uses the latest browser and DOM APIs for scrolling and snapping.

## Features

- Native **browser scroll-snapping and smooth-scrolling** for performant transitions across pointer types.
- **Comprehensive behavior and accessibility coverage** for all elements of a carousel, including pagination, infinite scrolling, autoplay, and more.
- Support for showing **one or many items per page**, implemented with responsive-design.
- Support for **vertical and horizontal** scrolling.
- Support for **infinite scrolling**.
- Support for **autoplay** with affordances for disabling it.
- Support for **mouse dragging**.
- Written in **TypeScript**.

## Installation

```sh
npm install react-aria-carousel
```

## Usage

### Anatomy

{/* prettier-ignore */}
```tsx
import {
  Carousel,
  CarouselButton,
  CarouselButton,
  CarouselItem,
  CarouselScroller,
  CarouselTab,
  CarouselTabs,
} from "react-aria-carousel";

<Carousel>
  <CarouselAutoplayControl />
  <CarouselButton dir="prev" />
  <CarouselButton dir="next" />
  <CarouselScroller>
    <CarouselItem />
  </CarouselScroller>
  <CarouselTabs>
    {(page) => (
      <CarouselTab index={page.index} />
    )}
  </CarouselTabs>
</Carousel>
```

Carousels have a root element denoting the carousel region, which contains all of the different parts of the carousel, including the scrolling container, next and previous buttons, and optionally, tabs and the autoplay toggle.

Below is a simple example with minimal styles to show all of the different parts working together.

<Basic />

### Multiple Items

The number of items present on a page can be changed with the `itemsPerPage` prop. You can change the spacing between items with the `spaceBetweenItems` prop.

<MultipleItems />

### Looping

By default, the carousel will not loop if one scrolls to either end. You can force the carousel to "wrap" in two different ways.

If the `loop` prop is set to `"infinite"`, the carousel will give the appearance of seamlessly wrapping to the opposite end.

If the `loop` props is set to `"native"`, the user still won't be able to scroll to the other end. However, the next and previous buttons and keyboard controls will scroll the user to the other end. ("Native" in this case means that the behavior of the scroll container aren't manipulated, it just provides the functionality to scroll the user to the other end.)

<Looping />

### Orientation

By default, the carousel will scroll horizontally. This can be changed to scroll vertically with the `orientation` prop.

<Orientation />

### Mouse Dragging

The carousel uses [CSS scroll snap](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-snap-type) to position slides at various snap positions. This allows users to scroll through the slides very naturally, especially on touch devices. Unfortunately, desktop users wonâ€™t be able to click and drag with a mouse, which can feel unnatural. The carousel provides this functionality with the `mouseDragging` prop.

This example is best demonstrated using a mouse. Try clicking and dragging the slide to move it.

<MouseDragging />

### Autoplay

Use the `autoplay` prop to automatically progress the carousel, dictated by the `autoplayInterval` prop. This functionality works great with the `loop` prop enabled. For best usability and accessibility, autoplay will pause if the user starts interacting with the carousel, and will resume when the stop interacting with it. Autoplay will also be disabled if the user's operating system or browser settings has the "prefers reduced motion" option enabled.

It's very important to include the `CarouselAutoplayControl` component when using this prop! Users must be able to disable this functionality.

<Autoplay />

### Scroll Hints

The carousel has two different ways to hint to users that there are more items in the carousel.

The `scrollPadding` prop simply applies [CSS scroll-padding](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/scroll-padding) to the scroll container. This has the effect of hinting the presence of items on either side of the carousel.

You can also manipulate the `itemsPerPage` prop to hint at more items. If you use a non-integer number, like `2.25`, the carousel will show a quarter of the following item in the list. This option has the benefit of keeping the edges of the carousel nicely aligned to its container (as opposed to `scrollPadding`).

<ScrollHints />

## Accessibility & Labeling

React Aria Carousel includes most required labels and HTML semantics by default, but requires a label (via `aria-label` or `aria-labelledby`) for the `Carousel` component for it to properly be described by screen readers.

All other aria attributes and descriptions are provided in English. For non-English languages, they can be overridden. Here's an example of the component translated to Italian:

Note: translations may be innaccurate, I used Google Translate for them :).

## Hooks

If you need to customize things even further, such as accessing internal state or customizing DOM structure, you can drop down to the lower level Hook-based API.

```tsx
import {
  useCarousel,
  useCarouselItem,
  useCarouselTab,
} from "react-aria-carousel";

export function Carousel() {
  const [assignScrollerRef, carousel] = useCarousel({
    spaceBetweenItems: "16px",
    itemsPerPage: 2,
  });

  const {
    rootProps,
    prevButtonProps,
    nextButtonProps,
    scrollerProps,
    tabProps,
    pages,
    autoplayControlProps,
  } = carousel;

  return (
    <div {...rootProps}>
      <button {...autoplayControlProps}>Toggle autoplay</button>
      <div>
        <button {...prevButtonProps}>Previous</button>
        <button {...nextButtonProps}>Next</button>
      </div>
      <div {...scrollerProps} ref={assignScrollerRef}>
        <CarouselItem index={0} state={carousel} />
      </div>
      <div {...tabProps}>
        {pages.map((_, i) => (
          <CarouselTab key={i} index={i} state={carousel} />
        ))}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

function CarouselItem({ index, state }) {
  const { itemProps } = useCarouselItem({ index }, state);
  return <div {...itemProps} />;
}

function CarouselTab({ index, state }) {
  const { tabProps } = useCarouselTab({ index }, state);
  return <div {...tabProps} />;
}
```

## API

### Carousel

The component accepts any valid HTML attributes, in addition to the following:

<PropTable data={propData.Carousel} />

### CarouselScroller

<PropTable data={propData.CarouselAutoplayControl} />

### useCarousel

<PropTable data={propData.useCarousel} />

### useCarouselItem

## Browser Support

A goal of this project is to use modern browser technology. While most APIs are widely supported, the [`scrollend`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element/scrollend_event) notably is not supported in Safari (as of May 2024). A polyfill is not included to future-proof the project, but you will likely want to include one.

- [react-snap-carousel](https://github.com/richardscarrott/react-snap-carousel) is another DOM-first, headless carousel for React that was a big insipiration for this project. It's less opinionated about the layout of the carousel (i.e., does not require CSS grid).
- [Shoelace carousel](https://shoelace.style/components/carousel) is a Web Component implementation for a DOM-first carousel, that can also be used in React. It's a bit more opinionated about the HTML layout and presentation of the carousel.
